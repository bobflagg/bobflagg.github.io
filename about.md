I'm a data scientist and a mathematician with a passion for machine learning, natural language processing and deep learning.
I work at <a href="https://www.finchcomputing.com/">Finch Computing</a> developing natural language processing 
models and algorithms to support named entity extraction, document clustering and classification, automated knowledge base population 
and entity linking.
